# web-scraping

Learned the very basics of Web Scraping and learned how I can build my own scraper with Python's [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library.

I wrote a simple script that fetch the basic info about the game from a [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) page(the page should have the games row column). 

This is what a games row look like ðŸ‘‡

The script that I wrote might have some issues, and if you find any please let me know.

### How can you run it yourself ?
- You will need to install python3 in your system if you haven't already.
- And you will need to install [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/), and [lxml](https://lxml.de/) library which you can easily do with pip.
- Use `pip install [LibraryName]` to install a library and of course replace the [LibaryName] with the actual name of the library you want to install.
